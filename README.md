Make videos like this one 


Steps to follow.

1. Download all the files to a single folder. All of them.

2. Place the clip you want to RIPeat in the folder and name it movie.mp4. Make sure it's a copy, since the movie file will be replaced by the final video. 

3. It better be 720p till I find out a way to make moviepy return sizes.

4. Run the python file

Man, I hope someone cleans up the moviepy documentation a bit.
